# Dis-Coin crypto on discord

This is a small project i have been working on alone for a few months.
The main idea was to let discord users around the world use cryptocurrency on discord freely - send, receive, gamble, open shops and way more to be introduced.

Unfortunately, as time went on i began to realise it won't work - the idea was essentially too flawed, no one would send their money to a untrusted wallet of a new project, to spread the word of a crypto project that is not a meme these days is quite hard and it would lose the main principle of cryptocurrencies - it wouldn't be decentralised if my discord bot was controlling all the funds including withdrawing and depositing.

The main code in this repo is Dis-Coin discord bot with a few essential features:

1. Sending (.send usertag amount)
2. Gambling (.dice .coinflip .jackpot)
3. Shops (.shop) - these let you open up a shop for your discord server, to sell up to 5 different roles (you can specify the price and the max amount sold) and to accept donations to the server
4. Other small functions like .help .info or .bind

The website design was taken from html5up.net (thanks to them) and changed a little bit. I also added the binding and depositing fields (assets/js/TransactionHandler)


#Update: 2023-01-27. This is made on currently a very outdated version of discord.js. If anyone is actually willing to use this, good luck :) I won't be maintaining this, as it was just a side project.
